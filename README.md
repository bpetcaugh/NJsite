# NJ DCF Website Repo
## Introduction
This website is being built by students at Holy Ghost Preparatory School, with oversight by their instructor (Mr. Brandon Petcaugh). It will serve to replace the existing site housing all files/policies/regulations for the NJ Department of Children and Families. [Link To Existing Site](https://www.nj.gov/dcf/policy_manuals/toc.shtml) 

## Public Website Functionality
This site will be used by the public to search and download policies. It also contains an email template which can be used to contact the department with any requests.

## Department Website Funcationality
This site will be used for three primary functions:
1. Add new policies and regulations
2. Mark policies as obsolete
3. Modify existing policies

Diagrams for the workflow of these functions will be placed here.

## General Information
### Who uses this site?
This site would be used internally by 46 local offices, with approximately 6600 staff, and 12 area offices.

### Sensitive Files
Some files were not included in this repository, since they contain passwords, database logins, or other sensitive information. These are available upon request. 

## Current Production ToDo List
This will be updated accordingly.
